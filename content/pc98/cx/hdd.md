Unlike some other machines, the PC-98s have a hard drive capacity limit in the BIOS. The maximum capacity will depend on the year the machine as manufactured.

In the case of the PC-9821Cx, this can be determined using the serial number.

The serial number has the following format:

| Year (199**X**) | Month | Remainder |
|-----------------|-------|-----------|
| X               | X     | 12345XX   |

For example, my machine's serial number is 5205216AA. The year number is 5 and the month is 2. This means my machine was manufactured in February 1995.

## What is the maximum hard drive size I can use?

Once you have the manufacture month and year, the following table will indicate what capacity is supported (shortened for brevity)[^source]:

| Size   | Manufacture date     |
|--------|----------------------|
| 570MB  | Before June 1994     |
| 4.56GB | June 1994 - May 1997 |

The PC-9821Cx was released in October 1994. This likely means that all PC-9821Cx machines that exist support up to 4.56GB of hard drive storage.
